# 🧭 Strategic Roadmap: What's Next?

We have successfully activated the user (Phase F) and built trust (Phase B, C). The system is now a "Glass Box" that users can see into.

The next challenge is **Control** and **Expansion**.

Here are the 3 strategic paths forward:

---

## Path 1: The "Editor" (Phase G) ✍️
**"That SOP is 90% right. Let me fix the last 10%."**

Currently, workflows are "read-only" artifacts generated by AI. If the AI gets it wrong, the user is stuck. This leads to churn.

**Scope**:
- **Visual Builder**: Make the Flowchart editable (drag-and-drop).
- **Node Configuration**: Click a node to edit its prompt/logic.
- **Save & Version**: Persist user edits as the new "Golden Source".

**Why this?**: It turns LiveSOP from a "Magic Trick" into a "Productivity Tool". High retention impact.

## Path 2: The "Brain" (Phase I) 🧠
**"Read my Knowledge Base before you decide."**

Currently, specific context (e.g., "Error 503 means Database") is inferred or hardcoded. Real teams have wikis, notion docs, and SLAs.

**Scope**:
- **RAG Engine**: Vector database (Chroma/Supabase pgvector) for KB articles.
- **Smart Context**: Inject relevant KB snippets into the decision prompt.
- **Citation**: "Escalated because of *Article #102: SLA Policy*".

**Why this?**: Increases accuracy and builds deeper trust ("It knows our rules").

---

## Path 3: The "Reach" (Phase K) 🔌
**"We use Zendesk, not Jira."**

Currently, we support Slack + Jira. This limits the Total Addressable Market (TAM).

**Scope**:
- **Zendesk**: Ticket creation and status sync.
- **Gmail**: Email-based triggers (already partially stubbed).
- **Intercom**: Chat-based triggers.

**Why this?**: Unlocks new customer segments.

## ⭐️ Recommendation

**I strongly recommend Path 1 (Phase G: Visual Workflow Builder).**

**Reasoning**:
1.  **Blocker Removal**: Users *will* want to change the AI's output. If they can't, they lose interest.
2.  **Engagement**: "Building" a workflow is a high-commitment action that increases detailed retention.
3.  **Foundation**: You need a stable way to *define* workflows before you make them "smarter" (Path 2) or "connected" (Path 3).

**Shall we proceed with Phase G?**
